## Overview

Managing identity and access is a critical cornerstone for enterprise security, agility and user experience today. It is critically important for  all users that include employees of an enterprise (B2E), consumers (B2C), as well as business customers, partners, or franchises (B2B).

The technical deep dive of this tutorial mainly focuses on managing secure and frictionless access for consumer facing applications (web and mobile), and B2B customer facing SaaS applications.

The tutorial illustrates B2C and B2B related access management requirements around a hypothetical veterinary service provider, "PetCare. PetCare offers a web and mobile application for pet owners to manage their pet details and vaccination status (B2C). Additionally, it provides a SaaS application for veterinary businesses to register and manage doctor appointments and medical records of pets treated (B2B).
